"""Magentic Workflow Example.

This module demonstrates a multi-agent workflow using the Magentic framework.
It orchestrates multiple specialized agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks.

The example workflow:
1. A users_agent handles user-specific information (identity, allergies, budget)
2. A manager_agent resolves location and time context
3. A chef_agent recommends meals based on all gathered context
4. A manager agent orchestrates the collaboration between agents
5. Results are streamed in real-time to provide visibility into the workflow

Requirements:
- Azure OpenAI service configured with appropriate credentials
- Environment variables loaded from .env file
- Azure CLI authentication configured
